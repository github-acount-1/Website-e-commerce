inside Shola\php\includes function are two files helpers_inc.php and db_inc.php

//db_inc.php
- this php file is used to setup connection to the database. you must not write your own database connection instead include this file in your php 
file. 

-It sets up both pdo and mysqli connections

-for the pdo connection the connection is set up and returned in $pdo function so make sure to use that if you are using pdo connection

//end db_inc.php

//helpers_inc.php
- helpers_inc.php includes a constant ROOT_DIR, this constant locates the root directory of the project
	for  windows its equal to c:\xampp\htdocs\shola
	for linux /opt/lampp/htdocs/shola
	
Steps to include files

1. if you want to include php files always locate and include helpers_inc relatively from your current directory

2. use ROOT_DIR constant to locate and include the file you want

e.g
a file in shola/php/classes wants to connect to database

file test.class.php

source code

<?php
	//this makes ROOT_DIR constant available for use
	require_once '../includes/helpers_inc.php  
	
	//this locates the neccessary file from the root directory
	require_once ROOT_DIR.'php/includes/db_inc.php
	
	//TODO
	
?>

//end helpers_inc.php
